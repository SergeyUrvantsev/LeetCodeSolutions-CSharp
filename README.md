## Structure

The project is structured into two main directories:

### `LeetCode.Solutions`

This directory contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, categorized by difficulty:
- `Easy`: Solutions to easy problems.
- `Medium`: Solutions to medium problems.
- `Hard`: Solutions to hard problems.

Each subdirectory contains individual C# files with solution implementations. üìÅ

### `LeetCode.Tests`

This directory contains corresponding unit tests for each solution, also organized by difficulty:
- `Easy`: Tests for easy problems.
- `Medium`: Tests for medium problems.
- `Hard`: Tests for hard problems.

Each subdirectory contains unit test files written using xUnit framework to test the solutions in the `LeetCode.Solutions` directory. üß™

## Getting Started

To get started with the LeetCode Solutions project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for running the project and tests.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SergeyUrvantsev/LeetCodeSolutions-CSharp.git
    cd LeetCode
    ```

2. Navigate to the test project and add a reference to the solutions project:

    ```bash
    cd LeetCode.Tests
    dotnet add reference ../LeetCode.Solutions/LeetCode.Solutions.csproj
    ```

Now you're ready to explore the solutions and tests or add your own contributions! üéâ

## Usage

The LeetCode Solutions project can be used for several purposes:

### Exploring Solutions

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in the `LeetCode.Solutions` directory. Each solution is categorized by difficulty level, making it easy to find solutions to specific types of problems.

### Running Tests

You can run the unit tests provided in the `LeetCode.Tests` directory to verify the correctness of the solutions. Navigate to the `LeetCode.Tests` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cd LeetCode.Tests
dotnet test
```

## Workflows

### dotnet.yml

The `dotnet.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for building and testing the project. This workflow runs on every push to the `main` branch and every pull request into the `main` branch. It performs the following tasks:
- Restores dependencies for the LeetCode.Solutions project.
- Restores dependencies for the LeetCode.Tests project.
- Builds the LeetCode.Solutions project in Release configuration.
- Runs the tests for the LeetCode.Tests project in Release configuration.

For more information, please refer to the [dotnet.yml](.github/workflows/dotnet.yml) file.
